# Calculator.java

Basic swing program which produces a calculator interface. 

Need to go back and account for decimals - I realized that as it is right now, a user is able to add more than one decimal point, creating errors when the JTextField String is parsed to a double. 

Also want to make the interface more visually appealing.
